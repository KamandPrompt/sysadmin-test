# Networking

## Problem Statement

1. Setup a script that sends an email to the admin every midnight the status of all the services, error logs of any (if present), suspicious user activity and system warnings.


2. For `students.iitmandi.ac.in`, you need to find out from what company the domain has been bought. For instance, I bought `abhigyan.xyz` domain name from [Namecheap.me](https://nc.me/). You need to find out from where did the institute buy the domain `students.iitmandi.ac.in`.

3. Find out all the open ports between ports 1-2000 on the [SNTC server](https://iitmandi.co.in/) using [Nmap](https://nmap.org/).   It's possible to find out all other open ports as well, but it takes a long time to scan all possible ports, so we restrict it to first 2000 ports. Nmap is a very powerful tool used for network discovery and security purposes.

## Deliverables

In your git repository whose link you will be submitting, make a file `Network.md` where you need to mention your approach for the first part and report your findings, how you did this, what all resources you took help from, and what you learnt.

If you are creating any script or code, make a folder named `System Status` and put it in the folder with a README. It would also be good, if you can link to a short video demoing the work.

Remember, do not worry if you are unable to complete it, just document whatever you were able to do. :)
